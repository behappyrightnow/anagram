# Step 9

In this step, we will add an Angular dependency in bower.json.
To make it work, please [install bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower), and then issue:
> bower update

You must issue this from the same folder that has bower.json.
This will bring in AngularJS into a folder called bower_components.

Proceed to Step 10 after you've done this.
