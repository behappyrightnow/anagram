# Step 8

In this step, we will add an Angular dependency in bower.json.
To make it easy for you to follow along, we have checked in the angular code that would have come in through bower.

When you do this in your projects, please [install bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower), and then issue:
> bower update

You must issue this from the same folder that has bower.json.
This will bring in AngularJS into a folder called bower_components.

Proceed to Step 9 after you've done this.
